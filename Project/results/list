1. Naive Bayes - (Without Tuning) - CV (average overall and not per class). Precision, Recall and F1 (per class and overall).
2. Random Forest - (Without Tuning) - CV (average overall and not per class). Precision, Recall and F1 (per class and overall).
3. Random Forest - (With tuning) - Set of parameters for which max f1. CV for that. Precision, Recall, F1 for the same.

4. SVM  (without tuning) - comutationally expensive. No CV/ Tuning results
5. DRONE (with LR) - (with and without tuning)
6. DRONE (WITH RFR) - (with and without tuning)
